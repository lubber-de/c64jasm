## Overview

C64jasm is a symbolic assembler for the Commodore 64 that supports:

- Windows, Linux and macOS (it runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/))
- fast, automatic recompilation (save a file and c64jasm automatically recompiles your .prg)
- extensions: extend the assembler standard library in JavaScript.  See [this blog post](https://nurpax.github.io/posts/2018-11-08-c64jasm.html) for more details.
- integrates with VSCode for recompilation, error diagnostics and debugging on VICE directly from the VSCode editor.

## Installation

In order to use the c64jasm assembler, you need to install the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [c64jasm command line compiler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/c64jasm)

Furthermore, if you wish to use c64jasm with VSCode, you should also install:

- [c64jasm VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nurpax.c64jasm)
- [VICE emulator](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/)

**Assembler installation**: `npm install -g c64jasm`

Upon successful installation, running `c64jasm --help` in your shell should work.

**VSCode extension**: Search for `c64jasm` in the VSCode marketplace and install.

**VICE**: See the [VICE website](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/) for download and installation instructions.  Once you have it installed, make sure the VICE emulator binary `x64` is in your `PATH`.

## Getting started

Assuming you successfully installed the C64jasm command line compiler, you should be able to compile and run some code.  Let's build an example project from the c64jasm project.

```
git clone https://github.com/nurpax/c64jasm
cd c64jasm/examples/sprites
c64jasm --out sprites.prg sprites.asm
x64 sprites.prg
```

You should see something like this in your VICE window:

![](img/sprites.gif "sprites.prg")

If you installed the necessary VSCode parts of VSCode, you should be able to load this example project in VSCode and build it with `Ctrl+Shift+P` + `Tasks: Run Build Task`.  Build errors will be reported under the Problems tab and you should be able to hit `F5` to start your program in VICE.

## Macro assembler

C64jasm has fairly extensive symbolic macro assembly support.  This includes macros, compile-time variables, for-loops, if/else, and source and binary file inclusion.

Assembler pseudo directives start with a bang `!`.  Examples: `!let`, `!if`, `!include`.

### Labels and nested label scopes

```c64
; Clear the screen RAM (all 1024 bytes)
clear_screen: {
    lda #$20
    ldx #0
loop:
    sta $0400, x
    sta $0400 + $100, x
    sta $0400 + $200, x
    sta $0400 + $300, x
    inx
    bne loop
    rts
}
```

A label followed by braces `{}` starts a new scope.  Labels declared inside the braces will be local to that scope.  Labels declared within such a scope can still be referenced by using the namespacing operator `::`, e.g.,

```c64
memset256: {
    ldx #0
loop:
    sta $1234, x
ptr:
    inx
    bne loop
    rts
}

; Use self-modifying code to set target ptr
; for a memset

    lda #<buf           ; take lo byte of 'buf' address
    sta memset256::ptr-2
    lda #>buf           ; take hi byte of 'buf' address
    sta memset256::ptr-1
    jsr memset256

buf: !fill 256, 0
```

You can guard a whole file inside a scope if you start the source file with `!filescope`:

```c64
; Contents of util.asm
!filescope util

!macro inc_border() {
    inc $d020
}
```

Using `util.asm` from another file:

```c64
; Contents of main.asm
!include "util.asm"

    +util::inc_border()
```

### Data directives

Emitting bytes/words:

```c64
foo:  !byte 0     ; declare 8-bit
bar:  !word 0     ; declare 16-bit int (2 bytes)
baz:  !byte 0,1,2 ; declare bytes 0,1,2

baz_256: ; 256 bytes of zero
    !fill 256, 0
```

Including other source files:

```c64
!include "macros.asm"
```

Including binary data:

```c64
!binary "file1.bin"       ; all of file1.bin
!binary "file2.bin",256   ; first 256 bytes of file
!binary "file2.bin",256,8 ; 256 bytes from offset 8
```

### Variables

You can declare a variable with `!let`.  You can use standard C operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `<<`, `>>` with them.

```c64
!let num_sprites = 4

    lda #(1 << num_sprites)-1
    sta $d015
```

Variables take on JavaScript values such as numbers, strings, arrays and objects.  We will explore later in this document why array and object values are useful.

### If...else

Conditional assembly is supported by `!if/elif/else`.

```c64
!let debug = 1

!if (debug) { ; set border color to measure frame time
    inc $d020
}
    ; Play music or do some other expensive thing
    jsr play_music
!if (debug) {
    dec $d020
}
```

### For-loops

To repeat a particular set of instructions or data statements, use `!for`.

Repeating code generation.  For-loops are typically written using the built-in `range()` function that returns an array of integers.  This works similar to Python's `range` built-in.

```c64
!let xyptr = $40   ; alias zero-page $40 to xyptr

; shift left xyptr by 5 (e.g., xyptr<<5)
!for i in range(5) {
    asl xyptr
    rol xyptr+1
}
```

Lookup table generation:

```c64
    lda #3            ; index == 3
    tax
    lda shift_lut, x  ; A = 1<<3

; Create a left shift lookup table
shift_lut:
    !for i in range(8) {
        !byte 1<<i
    }
```


### Macros

Macros are declared using the `!macro` keyword and expanded by `+macroname()`.

```c64
; move an immediate value to a memory location
!macro mov8imm(dst, imm) {
    lda #imm
    sta dst
}

+mov8imm($40, 13)  ; writes 13 to zero page $40
```

## C64jasm <span style='color:red'>‚ù§</span> JavaScript

Extending the assembler with JavaScript was the primary reason why C64jasm was built.  This is a powerful mechanism for implementing lookup table generators, graphics format converters, etc.

This section will be expanded to cover various uses such as computing sine tables, importing sprite graphics .SPD files, loading in SID music, etc.

You can check out the [example project](https://github.com/nurpax/c64jasm/tree/master/examples/sprites) for a simple example.  You can also read [this blog post](https://nurpax.github.io/posts/2018-11-08-c64jasm.html) that expands on my motivation for an extensible assembler.
